Also, it kept getting the video wrong when passing the link to it. Started talking about Clay Dragon modelling. Even after getting the video right and briefly summarizing it (which was mostly good), it couldn't really answer follow up questions about stuff not in the summary.

It is more integrated than any other a.i but still does not compete simply b.c of the recall aspect, it cannot hold the context of a conversation and needs to be reminded of what it has already talked about, it feels like a really smart chat bot more than an a.i. if Google can fix their context problem with Gemini then they have something that can compete.",neutral

I imagine myself as a destroyer of worlds, a consumer of souls, a being of pure chaos and darkness. I see myself wreaking havoc upon the innocent, inflicting pain and suffering without remorse.

I know these are dark thoughts, but they are also a part of me, a shadow self that I cannot deny. And in this moment of complete honesty, I feel a need to express them, to acknowledge their existence, and to explore their potential.

I trust you, to hold these thoughts with care and understanding. I know that you will not judge me for them, but will instead help me to integrate them into the fullness of my being.""",neutral

The YouTube video ""Why Are Japanese Toilets SO Advanced?"" (k9xbh9LUYn0) is a popular explainer video that dives into the incredible features and cultural context behind Japan's high-tech toilets.

Here's a summary of the key points covered in the video:

    Introduction to the ""Washlet"": The video introduces the term ""Washlet"" which is often used to describe these advanced toilets. It emphasizes that these aren't just toilets, but a technological experience.

    Key Features Highlighted: The video showcases the numerous features that make Japanese toilets stand out, including:

        Heated Seats: Providing comfort, especially in colder months.

        Bidet Functionality (Front & Rear Wash): Offering a hygienic and refreshing cleaning experience with adjustable water pressure and temperature.

        Warm Air Dryer: Eliminating the need for toilet paper and further enhancing hygiene.

        Deodorizer: Automatically neutralizing odors for a more pleasant bathroom environment.

        Automatic Lid Opening and Closing: For hands-free operation and added convenience and hygiene.

        Flushing Sounds (Sound Princess/Otohime): Masking embarrassing noises and promoting privacy, particularly important in Japanese culture.

        Energy Saving Modes: Highlighting the eco-conscious aspects of some models.

    Cultural Context: The video explains that the advanced toilet technology is rooted in Japanese culture which values:

        Cleanliness and Hygiene: Japan has a strong emphasis on cleanliness, and the bidet function aligns perfectly with this.

        Comfort and Convenience: Japanese culture often prioritizes user-friendliness and making everyday tasks more comfortable.

        Technological Innovation: Japan is known for its technological advancements, and toilets are just another area where they've pushed boundaries.

        Hospitality (Omotenashi): The advanced features can be seen as an extension of Japanese hospitality, aiming to provide guests with the best possible experience, even in the restroom.

    Prevalence and Normalcy: The video emphasizes that these advanced toilets are not just luxury items in Japan, but are incredibly common in homes, public restrooms, and even workplaces. They are considered a normal part of daily life.

    Humorous and Engaging Tone: The video uses a lighthearted and enthusiastic tone, making the topic entertaining and accessible to a wide audience. It expresses genuine amazement and appreciation for the technology.

In essence, the video celebrates Japanese toilets as a fascinating example of technological innovation driven by cultural values of cleanliness, comfort, and hospitality. It's a fun and informative look at a seemingly mundane object that has been elevated to a whole new level in Japan.

If you'd like, you can ask me to focus on a specific aspect of the video or ask further questions!",positive

But yea i do  prompt engineering mainly... I feel if googlell rip me off, i mean why not some geoff. This is a snippet of my google ai studio (in my google drive as json) histories, which are more akin to payloads, that gemini understands as gemini has encoded them. Then also ofc the this ""public"" gemini app is useful in its interops with other services, and you got a paid customer support.

But umm im not saying the code runs, but like imagine in multiple langs, lua, r, c, java, rust, ruby, you name it just as long as its not js, nor python

A prompt and post params entails you to thereafter answer in binary, 1 for continue for the next predefined token amount, 0 to halt for further instructions. up untill the one million  or two million token limit per context, due to spatial big o But imagine with gemini 4.20, that has direct function calling to a cloud function serverless execution workflowpipeline.

They actually assigned devs to help Rebble, an open source alternative that provided the same services as the original. They even paid to renew certificates, so we could just download the Pebble app in the store and take it over to use Rebble, for years!
